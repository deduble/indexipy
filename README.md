Sure, here's a sample README.MD file for your "Indexipy" package:

```
# Indexipy

Indexipy is a Python package that brings advanced indexing concepts from NumPy to Python containers, such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries. The package is designed to make indexing more intuitive and powerful, providing a set of easy-to-use tools for accessing and manipulating elements in your containers.

## Installation

To install Indexipy, simply use pip:

```
pip install indexipy
```

## Usage

Indexipy provides a set of functions and classes for indexing containers. Here are some examples:

```python
from indexipy import Index

import numpy as np

# Create an Array object from a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
my_array = Array(my_list)

# Index using a list of indices
result = my_array[[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]
# Output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
print(result)

# Index using a boolean mask
mask = np.array([True, False, True, False, True, False, True, False, True])
result = my_array[mask]
# Output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
print(result)

# Index using a slice and a list of indices
result = my_array[1:6:2, [1, 3]]
# Output: [[2, 4], [4, 6], [6, 8]]
print(result)
```

Indexipy also provides some additional features, such as slicing, fancy indexing, and boolean indexing.
